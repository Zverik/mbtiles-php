MBTiles PHP backend

put those 2 files into any directory along with *.mbtiles
now ..../<name>/z/x/y.png is read from <name>.mbtiles

Note: user infostreams almost completely rewrote the script
to support UTFGrid, tilejson configuration etc. I recommend
using his branch: https://github.com/infostreams/mbtiles-php/
